As the game start the zombies become randomized and each one has different bar of health which is being randomized to make the game intersting and they are appearing randomly on the screen with the motion in random direction.

When the player clicks the space bar the special power follows a straight path toward the direction of your motion. It it hits a monster,the energy gets destroyed and monster loses some part of their health

If the player touched by a zombie he loses one life and will die if he loses 3 health and on the road he collect the money as he want.The appearance of these monster can't be controlled,They will appeared anywhere on the path and try to attack you
